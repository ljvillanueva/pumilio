# About

Pumilio is a PHP/MySQL application that serves as a sound archive manager
 and allows the user to load sound files in many formats and see the
 spectrogram of the sound, select regions of the sound for further
 analysis and insertion in a database, filter, and many other manipulations.

Read the INSTALLATION file to install and the UPGRADE file to upgrade.

Check the website for an installatio overview, guides, and videos:

Versions with a ".dev" suffix are not official and are in the middle of 
 development. Use these versions with caution as some features may be 
 broken.

To prevent access to the original sound files from the web (for example, someone trying to 
 download your whole dataset), rename the file "htaccess" to ".htaccess" (starting with a period)
 and place it in the main folder of the application.
 The apache server must be configured to allow this option. 

 In Ubuntu:
 ```bash
  sudo a2enmod rewrite
  sudo service apache2 restart
  ```
 For other distros or options, please consult your administrator.
